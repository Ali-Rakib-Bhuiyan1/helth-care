This usually involves a physical examination, review of your symptoms and medical history, and may also require diagnostic testing to either confirm an initial diagnosis or rule out other causes. For example, X-rays may be necessary to identify tiny fractures or other structural issues; a swab of the throat may be necessary to confirm the presence of strep throat or a urine test may be required to confirm whether you are pregnant.When you come to Cornerstone Urgent Care Center in Chili, Rochester, New York, our on-site diagnostic radiology and clinical laboratory services can help get you properly and quickly diagnosed.",
